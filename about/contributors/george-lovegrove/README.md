**Professional background**

Software developer of over 6 years in web and mobile development environments. More details can be found on LinkedIn.



**Relevant experience**

I have already spent over a year analysing treasury systems with the Web3 Association and shared a number of suggestions that could be highly impactful for Web3 ecosystems to explore. Prior to the Web3 Association I contributed towards the funding process from Cardano called[ Project Catalyst](https://projectcatalyst.io/). I created analytical resources on the topic area of [funding categorisation approaches](https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/funding-categorisation-analysis/) to help with finding more effective solutions. That analysis work led to changes being made to the funding process which even using [conservative estimates resulted in about a 200%](https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/funding-categorisation-analysis/historical-analysis-and-comparisons/categorisation-overall-cost-comparison) return on investment in a single funding round. The Web3 Association was started to continue these efforts with a new focus around collaborating with the wider industry to help improve treasury systems.
