Fix the incentives through the evolution of treasuries.



üéØ [**Focus**](focus.md)

Our focus is to collaborate with existing teams across Web3 ecosystems and help them with improving their treasury systems. To achieve this we initially have focused on creating educational resources that can provide insights and actionable information about treasury systems could be approached. Over time Web3 Association is looking to create the industry preferred destination to learn about Web3 treasuries. We're now looking to increase the number of experiments that are happening across the industry and to help nurture and grow a collaborative effort that can bring people together from across the industry to more effectively share knowledge and experiment with promising approaches.



üí° [**Approach**](approach/)

Our initial contribution outcome focus has been the creation of educational resources about treasury systems. These provide insightful and actionable information about Web3 treasuries that teams can use when improving their own treasury systems. A shared learning approach has been adopted that focuses on increasing the amount of collaboration and shared learnings across the industry. Educational resources have helped to identify promising experiments and learning opportunities which is a large part of our focus moving forward.
