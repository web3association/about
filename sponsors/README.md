### 2023 F**ounding sponsorship request**

Weâ€™re looking for founding sponsors to help fund our initial year of contribution efforts towards supporting the ongoing improvement of treasury systems across web 3 ecosystems.

Suitable sponsors could come from any blockchain ecosystem that manage a treasury or applications building on those blockchains that also rely on treasury systems. Government grants and any relevant organisation, investment firm or trust that would benefit or like to support this area of work could also be suitable sponsors.

Our priority is to maximise participation from different teams across web 3 ecosystems which share the common problem of needing an effective treasury solution to effectively manage their assets to best support the growth of their community.

Sponsorship requests from the Web 3 Association will come in the form of submitted proposals into existing web 3 treasury systems, sponsorship requests directly to foundations and any teams who maintain blockchains or decentralized applications and also to any relevant organisations or investors that could be interested in supporting this work.



### **Potential future scope**

For now our sole priority is focussed on producing the initial round of knowledge based resources and collaborating with any existing project teams so we can provide value as soon as possible. After our first rounds of contribution we can then discover how our efforts could even more effectively help existing teams improve their own treasury solutions more efficiently and effectively.

Over time, once we have proven the learning based model provides an effective way to provide value to a diversity of teams, we can then explore what other forms of sponsorship or membership based models could be considered to try and provide even more value to any sponsors and members. That value could come in different forms with ideas ranging from more technical or consulting support, mentoring or more thorough analysis and feedback regarding their own solutions.
