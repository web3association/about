### 2023 F**ounding sponsorship requests**

Weâ€™re looking for founding sponsors to help fund our initial year of contribution efforts towards supporting the ongoing improvement of treasury systems across web 3 ecosystems.

Suitable sponsors could come from any blockchain ecosystem that manage a treasury or applications building on those blockchains that also rely on treasury systems. Government grants and any relevant organisation, investment firm or trust that would benefit or like to support this area of work could also be suitable sponsors.

Our long term priority is to maximise participation from different teams across web 3 ecosystems which share the common problem of needing an effective treasury system to effectively manage and distribute their assets to most effectively support the growth of their community.

Sponsorship requests from the Web 3 Association will come in the form of submitted proposals into existing web 3 treasury systems, sponsorship requests directly to foundations, direct communication to any relevant teams that maintain blockchains or decentralized applications and also to any relevant organisations or investors that could be interested in supporting this work.



### Sponsorship tiers

Sponsors can donate whatever amount they want to help our contribution efforts towards supporting and improving treasury systems. When we share who the sponsors are for making these resources we will group them into the following tiers so that it is more visible to the public about how much any ecosystem or organisation has donated.



**Sponsorship tier amounts**

* **Bronze** - $5,000+
* **Silver** - $25,000+
* **Gold** - $50,000+
* **Platinum** - $100,000+



### **Potential future scope**

For now our sole priority is focussed on producing the initial round of knowledge resources and collaborating with any existing project teams so we can provide value as soon as possible.

Once we have proven the shared learning approach is an effective way to provide value to a diversity of teams building treasury solutions we can then explore what sponsorship changes or membership based models could be useful and how those changes could provide more value to the sponsors and members. Areas of consideration could be around providing more technical or consulting support, mentoring or even targeted workshops.
