# üó∫ Roadmap

### Potential t**reasury focus areas**

The following are some example areas of focus that can be researched and analysed to help identify areas of improvement for the different existing treasury solutions. This list is not exhaustive and will be updated over time to include more areas for consideration that would benefit from further contributions to identify any potentially impactful learnings.

üå± **Funding process**

Looking at relevant steps relevant to a full funding process going from how funding comes into the process and how funding is then distributed, measured and reviewed.

* **Funding Sources** - Exploring the different income streams that grow community treasuries such as protocol taxation or donations. What kind of funding sources exist and which ones are currently working most effectively?
* **Community Prioritisation** - Communities should be able to prioritise where they believe the most effort and contribution should be directed towards. This influences how funding will be distributed and what funding processes a community uses to address the most important priorities. One example of prioritisation could be the usage of community goal and objective setting to see what consensus exists if any around what the community currently most prioritises. Part of prioritisation will be looking at the processes and mechanisms needed to effectively communicate, debate and collaborate on a range of ideas and problem areas that need sufficient discussion to make well informed prioritisation decisions.
* **Funding Initiative Types** - Exploring what types of funding initiatives can exist, what they are useful for and what information is required for them to be effective. Proposal types could help with funding different types of ideas, tasks or contributors.
* **Proposal Assessment** - Once a structure is established to gather information about how funding can be distributed to different types of initiatives a follow on step will be to determine if that initiative is of high quality or not and whether it could be impactful. An assessment process can help with addressing this by identifying any merits, opportunities and potential issues behind each proposal that is seeking funding.
* **Community Decision Making** - A community could adopt a range of approaches to help guide the decision making process of deciding which proposals to fund for different funding initiatives. Considerations are needed on whether a qualitative process is needed that brings community members together or what dat and insights can be integrated into the process to better inform community members when making their own decision.
* **Voting Mechanisms & Approaches** - What voting approaches can be used to select and vote on proposals in each funding initiative? Understanding the tradeoffs of each voting approach will help with the creation of suitable voting systems for different uses cases and types of funding initiative. Voting weighting models will also be a point of consideration looking at how factors such as skill or length of contribution could be applied to vote weightings. Voting could use a yes or no system, preference based voting, quadratic voting or other forms of voting.
* **Funding Distribution Mechanisms** - Funding could be distributed to selected proposals in a number of ways such as through milestones, time based segmentation, all at once or upon completion of the proposals intent. Different funding initiatives may be more suited to different ways and cadences of distributing any allocated funding based on the risks and complexities of the funding initiative type and selected proposal itself.
* **Tracking Progress & Completion** - A community will benefit from being able to measure and verify the progress and completion of any of the funded proposal. Distribution mechanisms used to distribute funding to the relevant contributors could also potentially include automated or community based review processes as part of the distribution process to sign off milestones and any completions. Improving this process will help with reducing the loss of treasury funding to time wasters, scams or underperforming proposals and also help with identifying the most effective actors for the execution of their proposal.
* **Measuring Impact** - The community benefits from reviewing any completed proposal to reflect and determine how impactful that allocation of resources and capital was to the selected initiative. Understanding the impact of each completed initiative will help with improving future funding distribution decisions to similar or competing initiatives.



‚öôÔ∏è **Funding system**

A funding process requires a system to be in place that helps the community conduct any funding processes and distribute funding to impactful initiatives.

* **Funding Categorisations & Weightings** - How funding is made available has an impact on what initiatives will be funded and the overall effectiveness of the funding process. Treasuries have the option to fund allocate resources to a handful or many types of initiatives and apply different allocations of funding to each. Making these decisions are difficult and any outcomes from these decisions determine how funding is directed to certain areas and groups of different initiatives.
* **Processes & Scheduling** - How a treasury handles the process and timeline for funding initiatives will impact what amount of involvement is needed by different actors at different stages. Is funding distributed in rounds or is it a continuous process? Are different stages of funding distribution better suited to round based funding or should they be continuously running?
* **Roles & Incentives** - The management of treasuries and any funding distribution process can include a range of roles to help ensure funds are responsibly and effectively managed and distributed. The incentives and responsibilities for each of the roles will impact how well they are actually performed and influence how each participating actor might behave. Longer term effort will look at where certain working areas can be automated with technology and where other areas benefit more from regular human involvement.
* **System & Process Changes** - Treasury systems need to be able to change and adapt with improvements and parameter changes to keep up to date and function effectively. Common treasury systems parameters will need to be well defined so community members understand their implications on how any potential changes could impact the management of the treasury and any funding processes. What thresholds and mechanisms are needed to enact any changes will also need to be considered.
* **Constitutions, Policies & Values** - The values and principles of a community can be documented and maintained to better inform internal and external members of a community what a given community most values. Other types of documentation such as policies, guidelines and others may also need to be considered.



### Initial contribution plan

The initial contribution plan will be to focus on the areas around understanding different funding initiatives and how they can be structured, assessed, measured and verified for progress, completion and the impact generated. Those applicable areas also mentioned above include:

* **Funding Initiative Types** - Understand the different ways in which funding could be distributed and their merits, drawbacks and tradeoffs. Once sufficient knowledge is achieved suggested solution approaches could help look at what data structures help to best record the information needed for each of those funding initiative types.
* **Proposal Assessment** - Exploring how proposals for each funding initiative type could be assessed to better determine their overall quality and their opportunity to create impact within the community.
* **Tracking Progress & Completion** - Identify how proposals in each funding initiative type could be measured for progress such as milestones or progress reports and how regular that process should be to be effective at supporting the funding proposals whilst also checking the intended execution is being delivered and completed.
* **Measuring Impact** - Research can look into breaking down how impact could be measured in different ways by the community by first identifying what data will be needed to make informed decisions and then what participation and voting could be needed by the community to reach some informative outcome in deciding how impactful each completed proposal was for different funding initiative types.



Each of these areas is closely connected with understanding how funding can be distributed to different initiatives and how proposals funded under these initiatives can be better assessed, understood, compared, tracked and measured. The initial goal will be to create a growing comprehensive source of knowledge that covers these areas in depth and that continue to be iterated on with continued feedback and further insights and data.



This initial plan of execution above is not set in stone and is a recommended starting point. When collaborating with any web 3 projects interested in this work we will reflect and consider on how the most impact could be provided through our contributions. If another area proves to be more impactful to work on in the short term then this can be considered on when to prioritise that work.
