# üó∫ Roadmap

## T**reasury focus areas overview**

The following are some example areas of focus to be researched and analysed to find any areas of improvement for existing treasury solutions. This list is not exhaustive and will be updated over time to include more areas of consideration.

üå± **Funding process**

The funding process means looking at any steps that are relevant to a full funding process. This includes going from how funding comes into the process itself and how funding is distributed, measured and then reviewed.

* **Funding Sources** - Exploring the different income streams that grow community treasuries such as protocol taxation or donations. What kind of funding sources exist and which ones are currently working most effectively?
* **Community Prioritisation** - Communities should be able to prioritise where they believe more effort and contribution should be directed towards. This influences how funding will be distributed and what funding processes a community uses to address the most important priorities. Community goal and objective setting could help with seeing what consensus exists if any around what the community currently most prioritises. Community prioritisation will also mean looking at the processes and mechanisms being used to effectively communicate, debate and collaborate on a range of ideas and problem areas so that sufficient discourse is achieved for the community to make well informed prioritisation decisions.
* **Funding Initiative Types** - Exploring what types of funding initiatives can exist, what they are useful for and what forms of information is required for them to be effective. Proposal types could include funding different types of ideas, tasks or contributors.
* **Proposal Assessment** - Once a structure is established for gathering information for the applicable funding initiative types a follow on step will be to determine if those initiatives are of high quality or not and whether they have the potential to be impactful. An assessment process can help with addressing this by identifying the merits, opportunities and potential issues behind each proposal that is seeking funding.
* **Community Decision Making** - A community could adopt a range of approaches to help guide the decision making process when deciding which proposals to fund for addressing different community priorities. Considerations are needed on whether a qualitative process is needed that brings community members together or what data and insights should be integrated into the process to better inform community members when making their own decisions.
* **Voting Mechanisms & Approaches** - What voting approaches can be used to select and vote on proposals in each funding initiative? Understanding the tradeoffs of each voting approach will help with the creation of suitable voting systems for different uses cases and types of funding initiative. The weighting models applied to voting will also be a point of consideration to consider factors of how and when skill or length of contribution time could be applied to vote weightings. Different forms of voting will need to be considered and their trade offs such as for a yes or no system, preference based voting, quadratic voting or any other form of voting.
* **Funding Distribution Mechanisms** - Funding could be distributed to selected proposals in a number of ways such as through milestones, time based segmentation, all at once or upon completion of the proposals intent. Different funding initiatives may be more suited to different release mechanisms and cadences of distributing their allocated funding based on the risks and complexities of the funding initiative type and proposal.
* **Tracking Progress & Completion** - A community will benefit from being able to measure and verify the progress and completion of any of the funded proposal. Distribution mechanisms used to distribute funding to the relevant contributors can also potentially include automated or community based review processes as part of the distribution process to sign off milestones and any completions. Improving this process will help with reducing the loss of treasury funding to time wasters, scams or underperforming proposals. It could also help with identifying the more effective contributors from looking at the execution of their own proposal.
* **Measuring Impact** - The community benefits from reviewing any completed proposal to reflect and determine how impactful that allocation of resources and capital was to the selected initiative. Understanding the impact of each completed initiative will help with improving future funding distribution decisions to similar or competing initiatives.



‚öôÔ∏è **Funding system**

The funding system helps the community execute any funding processes and distribute funding.

* **Funding Categorisations & Weightings** - How funding is made available has an impact on what initiatives will be funded and the overall effectiveness of the funding process. Treasuries have the option to allocate resources to a handful or many types of initiatives and apply different allocations of funding to each. Making these decisions is difficult as any outcomes from these decisions determine how funding is directed to certain areas and groupings of initiatives.
* **Processes & Scheduling** - How a treasury handles the process and timeline for funding initiatives will impact what amount of involvement is needed by different actors at different stages. It also determines how often funding is distributed and made available to the community. Is funding distributed in rounds or is it a continuous process? Should the different stages of funding distribution use a mix of a round based process and continuous process?
* **Roles & Incentives** - The management of treasuries and any funding distribution process can include a range of roles to help ensure funds are responsibly and effectively managed and distributed. The incentives and responsibilities that get applied to each of these roles will impact how well they are perform over a long arch of time and also influence how each participating actor could actually behave. Over a longer time horizon effort could be directed towards looking where certain working areas could be automated with technology and where other areas benefit more from human contribution and involvement.
* **System & Process Changes** - Treasury systems need to be able to change and adapt with improvements and parameter changes to keep up to date and keep functioning effectively. Common treasury systems parameters will need to be well defined so community members understand their implications and how potential changes could impact the management of the treasury and any funding processes. What thresholds and mechanisms are needed to enact any changes will also need to be considered.
* **Constitutions, Policies & Values** - The values and principles of a community can be documented to better inform internal and external community members what that ecosystem most values. Other types of documentation such as policies, guidelines and others may also need to be considered.



### Initial contribution plan

The initial contribution plan is to focus on the areas around understanding how to approach community prioritisation and the different funding initiatives types which include how they can be structured, assessed, measured and verified for progress, completion and the impact generated. Those selected areas of focus (mentioned above) are:

* **Community prioritisation** - Identifying how a community can prioritise certain areas or problems that should be addressed in the ecosystem. Efforts here should look at the approaches that could be taken and the impact of doing prioritisation at different levels of specificity.
* **Funding Initiative Types** - Understand the different ways in which funding could be distributed with each approaches merits, drawbacks and tradeoffs. Once a sufficient understanding is reached suggestions for exploration can be made and implementation suggestions for what data structures could effectively record the information needed for those funding initiative types.
* **Proposal Assessment** - Exploring how proposals for each funding initiative type could be assessed to better determine their overall quality and their opportunity to create impact within the community.
* **Tracking Progress & Completion** - Identify how proposals in each funding initiative type could be measured for progress such as milestones or progress reports and how regular that process should be for it to be effective at supporting the funded proposers whilst also checking the intended execution is actually being delivered and completed.
* **Measuring Impact** - Research can look into breaking down how impact could be measured in different ways by the community. First that will include identifying what data will be needed to make informed decisions and then next will be what participation and voting is needed for the community to reach some outcome in deciding how impactful each completed proposal was.



Each of these areas is closely connected with understanding the funding process itself and how funding can be directed towards certain priorities and distributed to different initiative types. This then leads to exploring how proposals funded under these initiatives can be better assessed, understood, compared, tracked and measured. The initial goal will be to create an initial set of knowledge resources that provide enough depth into these areas to provide value to different ecosystems and then to iterate and improve them as more data and insights become available.



This initial plan of execution above is not set in stone and is a recommended starting point. When collaborating with any teams building treasury solution and those interested in this work we will reflect and consider on how the most impact we could generate through considering other forms of contribution. If another area proves to be more impactful for us to make contributions towards in the short term then how this work can be prioritised should be considered.
