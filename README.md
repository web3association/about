Our [funding analysis](https://app.gitbook.com/o/jOQu4b6VLDxaQsg2rVwG/s/8L61e8ulVlk90t5mlQk1/) has helped to highlight the opportunity of experimenting with a contributor funding process as a highly promising solution for Web3 ecosystems.

A proposal to experiment with [open source contributor funding ](https://app.gitbook.com/s/Zzfl1XcpAphbCFDyUysC/proposal/open-source-contributors)has been shared publicly to highlight the advantages of this suggested funding process.&#x20;

The objectives, development roadmap and setup process for trialling a [contributor funding process](https://app.gitbook.com/s/MknWvDkc5shALcb0cpEH/contributor-funding-experiment) have been documented. This also includes an [example contributor funding process](https://app.gitbook.com/o/jOQu4b6VLDxaQsg2rVwG/s/ZE8rIZvI1VylVcwzSPzR/) to showcase what the process could look like in practice.

Our suggested contributor funding experiment would cost less than $10,000 to operate and execute from start to finish. This costing includes any usage or tools and services and the [funding operators contribution costs](https://funding.contributors.org/contributor-funding-experiment/experiment-setup/time-and-cost-estimates).

If you're ecosystem is interested in running a contributor funding experiment please[ reach out to us](about/links-and-contact-information.md) at any time.
