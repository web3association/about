‚≠ê **Mission**

Accelerate the evolution and adoption of web 3 technology through increasing the availability and ongoing improvement of knowledge based resources and open source software.



üéØ **Focus**

To support existing teams across web 3 ecosystems in improving their treasury systems through the creation and iterative improvement of knowledge based resources that over time become the go to resource to learn about treasury systems.



üí° **Approach**

W3A will adopt a shared learning approach which focuses on gathering information, understanding the problem and potential solutions, questioning approaches taken, analysing current usage and adoption of different solutions and documenting ways in which treasury systems can be better managed and improved. The knowledge and resources generated from these shared learnings will help with the creation of suggested solution approaches. Open source reference implementations will also be explored over the medium term once the more popular solution approaches emerge which can then help existing teams who want to integrate open software into their own treasury solutions.



üó∫Ô∏è **Roadmap**

Initial contributions would look to focus on foundational areas of treasury systems. This includes how funding gets directed to different funding initiatives. This includes looking at funding initiative types and proposal structures, how proposals can be effectively assessed, how funding initiatives can be tracked and measured and also how the impact of funding initiatives can be measured.



:green\_heart: **Sponsors**

The W3A are looking for founding sponsors to help fund our initial year of contribution efforts to improve treasury systems across web 3 ecosystems.
