⭐ **Mission**

Fixing the incentives with Web3.&#x20;



🎯 [**Focus**](about/focus.md)

We think about incentives, governance and economics. We analyse treasuries, funding processes, organisations and money. Our focus is to collaborate with existing teams across Web3 ecosystems and help them with improving their treasuries, funding processes, governance, organisations and money. We create educational resources that provide insightful and actionable information about these systems and how they could be approached. Over time Web3 Association is looking to create the industry preferred destination to learn about Web3 treasuries and funding processes. We actively look to help with starting experiments and collaborations that can generate new learnings that can improve the Web3 industry.



💡 [**Approach**](about/approach/)

Our initial contribution outcome focus has been the creation of educational resources about treasury and funding systems. These provide insightful and actionable information about Web3 treasuries that teams can use when improving their own treasury systems. A shared learning approach has been adopted that focuses on increasing the amount of collaboration and shared learnings across the industry. Educational resources have helped to identify promising experiments and learning opportunities which is a large part of our focus moving forward.
