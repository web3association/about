‚≠ê **Mission**

Fix the incentives through the evolution of treasuries.



üéØ [**Focus**](focus.md)

Our focus is to support existing teams across Web3 ecosystems with improving their treasury systems. We achieve this through the creation and continued improvement of knowledge resources that help provide insights and actionable information for teams to use when improving their own treasury systems. The Web3 Association is looking to create the industry preferred destination to learn about Web3 treasuries. We're looking to nurture and grow a collaborative effort to bring people together from across the industry to more effectively share knowledge about how treasuries can be approached to more effectively generate impact.



üí° [**Approach**](approach/)

Our core contribution outcome will be the creation of knowledge resources about treasury systems that provide insightful and actionable information for teams to use when improving their own treasury systems across Web3. A shared learning approach is being adopted that will focus on increasing the amount of collaboration and shared learnings for the benefit of all teams building solutions. Creating knowledge resources will mean identifying one focus area at a time, inviting collaborators to participate, conducting research and analysis and then making suggestions based upon those findings. Knowledge resources are the core focus and outcome from our contribution efforts. Over a longer time horizon there should also be opportunities for us to generate more impact for treasury systems by helping create open source software and supporting any standardisation efforts.
