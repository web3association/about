‚≠ê **Mission**

Accelerate the adoption of web 3 technology through supporting the ongoing improvement of treasury systems



üéØ [**Focus**](focus.md)

Support existing teams across web 3 ecosystems with improving their treasury systems through the creation and iterative improvement of knowledge resources. These resources will provide insights and actionable information for teams to use when iterating and improving their own treasury system. The Web 3 Association is looking to become the industry preferred destination to learn about treasury systems.



üí° [**Approach**](approach/)

A shared learning approach will be adopted that focuses on collaboration between ecosystems and creating knowledge resources that can support and improve treasury systems across these ecosystems. Creating knowledge resources will involve identifying one focus area at a time, inviting collaborators to participate, conducting research and analysis and then making suggestions based upon those findings. Knowledge resources are the key focus and outcome produced from any contribution efforts. Over a longer time horizon there will also be opportunities to generate more impact in supporting and improving treasury systems by helping create open source software and supporting any standardisation efforts.



üó∫Ô∏è [**Roadmap**](roadmap.md)

The initial focus is around foundational areas of the funding process such as how funding gets directed to different funding initiatives. This initial focus includes looking at what funding initiative types and proposal structures can exist, how proposals can be effectively assessed, how funding initiatives can be tracked and measured and then also how the impact of those funding initiatives can be reviewed.



:green\_heart: [**Sponsors**](sponsors/)

The Web 3 Association will be looking for founding sponsors to help fund our initial year of contribution efforts to support and improve treasury systems across web 3 ecosystems.
