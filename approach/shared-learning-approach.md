# ðŸŽ“ Shared learning

How can we increase the rate in which treasury systems are improved across Web3 ecosystems so that they create increasingly impactful outcomes that support and grow their ecosystems more effectively? What complimentary approaches could be integrated into an existing teams development process to help them iterate and improve their own solutions more quickly?



Shared learning across the industry can help with answering these questions and potentially provide an effective path to increasing the adoption of Web3 technology through the adoption of an efficient and effective approach to improve treasury systems.



### Current problems



**Time consuming to keep up to date with industry progress**

There are numerous different Web3 ecosystems that each have their own treasury to manage. On top of this there are also often a number of applications building their own solutions in these ecosystems that also require effective ways to manage and distribute a treasury. The vast number of projects building in parallel makes it increasingly difficult for existing teams to have enough time to find out what is happening across the industry. Not seeing the outcomes of the different developments happening in these different treasury systems makes it easier to miss insightful learnings or ideas on how to better approach solving their own treasury problems.



**Difficulty in determining which solutions are working most effectively**

Existing treasury solution builders often have limited capacity to spend time looking at other treasury solutions due to the level of effort required to understand any analyse these alternative approaches whilst also trying to build their own solution. Sufficient analysis is needed to review the data and impact generated from these different approaches for improving treasury systems to more confidently identify which approaches are truly effective or not.



**Lost learnings from failed or pivoted projects**

Treasury systems are complex and require ongoing iteration and improvement. Ideas are often trialled then discarded once the outcomes do not produce sufficient impact. As each ecosystem does these experiments in parallel it will be easy for those learnings to not to be documented and be widely shared. A lack of available learnings on what approaches havenâ€™t worked for other ecosystems can easily result in many ecosystems taking a similar and ineffective approach due to a lack of available insights around the issues that certain approaches may have.



**Isolated learning & duplicated efforts**

Without any external supportive structures and collaborators in place most treasury teams could learning in isolation on how to improve and iterate on their own solution. A lack of external collaborators decreases the amount of available skill sets and thought diversity that could have helped with more efficiently identifying good solutions to the range of different treasury problem areas. There is also no direct incentive for competing ecosystems to collaborate with other projects. Reduced collaboration results in less flow of information and insights between these ecosystems. This lack of collaboration comes at the detriment of the wider industry as it means a reduced speed in which each ecosystems can identify useful insights to make well informed decisions on how to improve their own treasury systems. Efforts can easily be duplicated across multiple ecosystems concerning research, analysis and experimentation of new approaches for improving treasury systems if each team working is working on these systems in isolation.



### **Shared learning**

A focus on shared learning means increasing the amount of available knowledge resources available for teams to use when improving and iterating on their own treasury systems. The goal of shared learning is to help maximise collaboration and any learnings made across the industry. This helps increase the rate in which existing treasury systems can be improved and more widely adopted. Knowledge resources will focus on providing insights and actionable information for each ecosystem so they can more quickly identify ways to improve their treasury system in being able to manage and distribute community assets. Focussing on collaboration and shared learning creates an opportunity to help the wider industry achieve their goals at a faster rate. Our goal is for our knowledge resources to eventually become the industry preferred location to learn about treasury systems.



A group of contributors focussed on shared learning creates the opportunity for a supportive structure for helping existing teams building treasury solutions. Contributors would directly collaborate with and help existing teams through research, analysis and suggestions that focus on improving the knowledge available about treasury systems. The main [contribution outcomes ](contribution-outcomes/)of an approach focussing on shared learning is the creation of knowledge resources for the benefit of ecosystems building treasury solutions. Over the longer term there is also an opportunity to help with the development of open source software and supporting standardisation efforts.



**Advantages**

* **Faster learning outcomes** - Bringing together deep research and data about the range of treasury systems across the industry will help with identifying all of the different approaches being taken to solve important treasury problems and which of them are working effectively or not. Case studies will help further bring light to these areas and showcase the different factors involved in these outcomes. These resources focussed on treasury systems can help with increasing the speed in which key learnings are shared between many ecosystems and help teams building solutions to better identify which approaches to avoid, explore further an embrace when improving their own solution.
* **More cost effective** - Insightful and actionable information about treasury systems is beneficial for many blockchains and applications across Web3 ecosystems. This creates the opportunity for a shared learning approach to be highly cost effective for these ecosystems as the cost of these contributions can be split between each of the participating ecosystems. The full outcome of any resources created would then be available to the entire industry. The more that the costs for these types of contributions can be shared across many ecosystems the more efficient the overall industry becomes. Increasing this efficiency also helps each ecosystem in being able to direct more funding to other impactful initiatives rather than doing similar work in isolation.
* **Reduce duplicated & wasted effort** - Each existing team in the industry wonâ€™t need to spend the same amount of time doing deep research and analysis if they can support an approach that efficiently creates those outcomes for them. Resources that increase the amount of knowledge available about treasury systems will help existing teams building treasury solutions be able to spend time on unsolved problems and avoid common pitfalls and mistakes. Reducing the amount of time teams need to research and analyse different approaches the more we can prevent the waste and duplication of efforts that yield similar outcomes. Quality knowledge resources can help teams identify effective solutions and promising areas to explore more efficiently than if they had to do that work themselves to arrive at these same conclusions.
* **Inspire new solution approaches** - Resources that cover a wide range of potential ways that a treasury system could be approached can help with inspiring existing teams in finding new and novel ways to approach solving different problems. More experimentation is greatly beneficial to the wider industry as any outcomes can be recorded and shared across different ecosystems when iterating on their own treasury system.
* **Increase collaboration** - A group of contributors creating knowledge resources for the wider industry about treasury systems would not be competing with existing teams building solutions. Ecosystems that financially support shared learning efforts help to align the incentives for increasing the amount of collaboration between as many teams as possible to create high quality resources that can generate ongoing impact for those ecosystems. The higher the participation is for this approach of improving the quality and availability of knowledge resources for treasury systems the faster that each team can iterate and improve their own solutions. Increasing the diversity of skills, backgrounds, values and cultures involved in the creation of these knowledge resources can help with ensuring the outcomes are more thorough and high quality. Feedback from many existing teams will also help with provide an effective path to iterate and improve resources and increase their overall impact.



**Potential issues**

* **Collaboration time cost** - Existing communities and projects may not have much time to give and receive feedback on different problem areas they are working on. This could make it difficult to create knowledge resources with the same detail of information. Although this could be a an issue it is not a blocker for making quality knowledge resources. Most data about the outcomes of many treasury systems is publicly available meaning it wouldn't prevent any contributors from being able to identify the approaches being used and what relevant insights and data points exist that can help identify effective solution approaches.



### **Summary**



**Complimentary and supportive approach**

Contributors focussed on shared learnings will be able to provide a complimentary and supportive structure to improve the knowledge and resources available around core focus area of treasury systems. Knowledge resources can be used across all Web3 ecosystems to help with improving their own treasury system. Incentivising shared learning at a foundational level can help better support existing teams who are building and learning about how to improve their own treasury system rather than working in isolation. A small capital allocation from different Web3 ecosystems towards increasing the amount of shared learning and knowledge available presents a large opportunity to increase the speed that Web3 ecosystems can collectively identify and adopt the more effective solutions. Quality knowledge, learnings and open source software that is readily available for usage and integration by existing project teams can help them to iterate more quickly and save time by reducing duplicated and wasted efforts.



**Effectively incentivised collaboration**

Contributors working under a shared learning approach are highly incentivised to collaborate with as many existing teams as possible to provide value and share learnings across Web3 ecosystems. Contributors supporting efforts to increase the knowledge around a given problem area are not competing with existing teams making treasury systems. Existing projects that benefit from more knowledge resources are more incentivised to support and collaborate with that ongoing work and provide feedback or request areas of improvement to further benefit the evolution of their own treasury system.



**Scalable knowledge and support structure**

Many problems faced by different Web3 ecosystems are shared across every ecosystem. An increasingly comprehensive knowledge base helps provide an economically efficient and scalable structure to support existing teams building treasury systems across multiple Web3 ecosystems. Efficiently identifying and sharing learnings and knowledge across different ecosystems means more funding can be saved and directed towards other important problems and experiments in each of those communities.



**Supportive structure for open source software and standardisation**

A shared learning approach provides a simple process driven way to increase the amount of knowledge available through ongoing research and analysis about treasury systems. As these resources mature there is an opportunity to create further impact for the industry by identifying areas where open source software could be produced and widely adopted due to identifying an effective approach that is being increasingly adopted. If ecosystems begin to converge on similar approaches to solve a certain treasury problem then the opportunity also emerges to consider how those solutions could be standardised.
