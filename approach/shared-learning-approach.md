# ðŸŽ“ Shared Learning Approach

How can we increase the rate in which treasury systems are improved across web 3 ecosystems so that they create increasingly impactful outcomes that support and grow their ecosystems more effectively? What complimentary approaches could be integrated into an existing teams development process to help them iterate and improve their own solutions more quickly?



A shared learning approach could help with answering these questions and potentially provide an effective path to increasing the adoption of web 3 technology through the adoption of an efficient and effective approach to improve treasury systems.



### Current problems



**Time consuming to keep up to date with industry progress**

There are numerous different web 3 ecosystems that each have their own treasury to manage. On top of this there are also often a number of applications building their own solutions in these ecosystems that also require effective ways to manage and distribute a treasury. The vast number of projects building in parallel makes it increasingly difficult for existing teams to have enough time to find out what is happening across the industry. Not seeing the outcomes of the different developments happening in these different treasury systems makes it easier to miss insightful learnings or ideas on how to better approach solving their own treasury problems.



**Difficulty in determining which solutions are working most effectively**

Existing treasury solution builders often have limited capacity to spend time looking at other treasury solutions due to the level of effort required to understand any analyse these alternative approaches whilst also trying to build their own solution. Sufficient analysis is needed to review the data and impact generated from these different approaches for improving treasury systems to more confidently identify which approaches are truly effective or not.



**Lost learnings from failed or pivoted projects**

Treasury systems are complex and require ongoing iteration and improvement. Ideas are often trialled then discarded once the outcomes do not produce sufficient impact. As each ecosystem does these experiments in parallel it will be easy for those learnings to not to be documented and be widely shared. A lack of available learnings on what approaches havenâ€™t worked for other ecosystems can easily result in many ecosystems taking a similar and ineffective approach due to a lack of available insights around the issues that certain approaches may have.



**Isolated learning & duplicated efforts**

Without any external supportive structures and collaborators in place most treasury teams could learning in isolation on how to improve and iterate on their own solution. A lack of external collaborators decreases the amount of available skill sets and thought diversity that could have helped with more efficiently identifying good solutions to the range of different treasury problem areas. There is also no direct incentive for competing ecosystems to collaborate with other projects. Reduced collaboration results in less flow of information and insights between these ecosystems. This lack of collaboration comes at the detriment of the wider industry as it means a reduced speed in which each ecosystems can identify useful insights to make well informed decisions on how to improve their own treasury systems. Efforts can easily be duplicated across multiple ecosystems concerning research, analysis and experimentation of new approaches for improving treasury systems if each team working is working on these systems in isolation.



### **Shared learning approach**

A shared learning approach focuses on increasing the amount of available knowledge and resources available for teams to use when improving and iterating on their own treasury systems. The goal of a shared learning approach is to help maximise collaboration and shared learnings across a given industry. This helps increase the rate in which existing processes, protocols and applications can be improved and more widely adopted. Knowledge resources for treasury systems will focus on providing insights and actionable information for each ecosystem to more quickly identify ways they can more effectively distribute and manage their own treasuries. Focussing on collaboration and shared learning creates an opportunity to help the wider industry achieve these goals at a faster rate. A key goal for the knowledge resources created is that over time they become the industry preferred location to learn about treasury systems.



A shared learning approach offers a supportive structure for helping existing teams building treasury solutions. Contributors would directly collaborate with and help existing teams through the research, analysis and suggestions they generate that help with improving the knowledge available about treasury systems. The main [contribution outcomes ](contribution-outcomes/)of this shared learning approach is to create knowledge resources for the benefit of ecosystems building treasury solutions however there is also an opportunity to help with the development of open source software and supporting standardisation efforts over the long term.



**Advantages**

* Quicker learning outcomes - Focussing on specific problem areas and bringing together research, analysis and case studies to create knowledge resources can help increase the speed in which key learnings are identified and shared across different ecosystems. Searching for feedback and suggestions for iteration of this knowledge resource can further help further tighten the iterative learning loop by integrating further insights and data to improve any currently established learnings. The faster these learning outcomes can be achieved and shared the higher the opportunity there is for solutions teams to iterate faster in adopting effective solutions. It can also help make it easier to identify where common solutions are emerging which could then be turned into open source reference implementations and even potentially standardised.
* Case studies of different solution approaches - Ongoing research towards what is happening across different treasury systems across the industry will help with identifying new and novel approaches to solving different problems. Keeping a log of these solutions and how they perform over time will create a useful reference resource for existing teams to better determine what has been effective and how they can consider and integrate those learnings into their own treasury systems improvement.
* Shared learnings & knowledge - Learnings that help highlight what effective solutions exist for solving certain problem areas can be shared across any of the teams building solutions across different blockchains, protocols and applications. Contributors focussed on improving the available learnings and knowledge have a direct incentive to collaborate with any existing projects and help aggregate any existing learnings and resources into a comprehensive knowledge resource to better help existing teams. The more that quality learnings, knowledge and resources can be shared across the wider web 3 ecosystems the quicker that each project teams will be able to learn and iterate on their own solutions as well as avoid any common pitfalls.
* Higher skill diversity - Existing project teams can benefit from a group of contributors that are incentivised to collaborate with existing projects as it gives them access to a more diverse range of skill sets and opinions that those teams may benefit from. Contributors focussed on increasing the amount of shared learnings, knowledge and resources available are able to provide their expertise and skills to any of the teams building solutions and potentially help fill in gaps of knowledge or expertise.
* Highly collaborative - Contributors focussed on a shared learning approach would not be competing with existing teams building solutions. Contributors would be directly incentivised to collaborate and share learnings, skills and knowledge with any projects working on treasury systems. Time can be allocated to provide support and useful information to these projects whenever it is highly beneficial for those teams. Projects implementing solutions benefit from being able to utilise any of the learnings and resources in anyway beneficial to their own efforts. Resources could save existing projects meaningful time and effort from doing everything themselves. Those teams would also have contributors that can support any of their own research and analysis efforts and do so in a collaborative manner as this outcome is beneficial both for that team and the wider industry. Feedback from projects building solutions will also help with guiding future efforts into identifying where further research and analysis could be conducted to create the most impactful learnings.
* Reduce wasted and duplicated effort - Contributors that increase the shared knowledge across ecosystems provides an opportunity to prevent existing teams from spending time researching, analysing and developing software that may already exist and that is freely available for them to use. The more this is achieved the more that each existing team can spend time on other important problems and helps tighten the loop of the time required to improve their own solutions. Increasing the efficiency of improving treasury systems creates an impactful return on investment for these ecosystems through supporting a shared learning approach.



**Potential issues**

* Collaboration time cost - Existing communities and projects may not have much time to give and receive feedback on different problem areas they are working on. This could make it difficult to create knowledge resources with the same detail of information. Although this could be a an issue it is not a blocker for making quality knowledge resources. Most data about the outcomes of many treasury systems is publicly available meaning it wouldn't prevent any contributors from being able to identify the approaches being used and what relevant insights and data points exist that can help identify effective solution approaches.



### **Summary**



**Complimentary and supportive approach**

A shared learning approach offers a complimentary and supportive structure to improve the knowledge and resources available around core focus area of treasury systems. Knowledge resources can be used across all web 3 ecosystems to help with improving their own treasury system. Incentivising shared learning at a foundational level can help better support existing teams who are building and learning about how to improve their own treasury system rather than working in isolation. A small capital allocation from different web 3 ecosystems towards increasing the amount of shared learning and knowledge available presents a large opportunity to increase the speed that web 3 ecosystems can collectively identify and adopt the more effective solutions. Quality knowledge, learnings and open source software that is readily available for usage and integration by existing project teams can help them to iterate more quickly and save time by reducing duplicated and wasted efforts.



**Effectively incentivised collaboration**

Contributors working under a shared learning approach are highly incentivised to collaborate with as many existing teams as possible to provide value and share learnings across web 3 ecosystems. Contributors supporting efforts to increase the knowledge around a given problem area are not competing with existing teams making treasury systems. Existing projects that benefit from more knowledge resources are more incentivised to support and collaborate with that ongoing work and provide feedback or request areas of improvement to further benefit the evolution of their own treasury system.



**Scalable knowledge and support structure**

Many problems faced by different web 3 ecosystems are shared across every ecosystem. An increasingly comprehensive knowledge base helps provide an economically efficient and scalable structure to support existing teams building treasury systems across multiple web 3 ecosystems. Efficiently identifying and sharing learnings and knowledge across different ecosystems means more funding can be saved and directed towards other important problems and experiments in each of those communities.



**Supportive structure for open source software and standardisation**

A shared learning approach provides a simple process driven way to increase the amount of knowledge available through ongoing research and analysis about treasury systems. As these resources mature there is an opportunity to create further impact for the industry by identifying areas where open source software could be produced and widely adopted due to identifying an effective approach that is being increasingly adopted. If ecosystems begin to converge on similar approaches to solve a certain treasury problem then the opportunity also emerges to consider how those solutions could be standardised.
