# üèÉ‚ôÇ Execution Process

The following is a first draft high level overview outlining a process that contributors could adopt and use for a learning focussed process to effectively support and improve treasury systems across web 3 ecosystems. Factors such as impact alignment, collaboration, improving the execution process, increasing participation diversity and providing ongoing maintenance and support to these contribution efforts will all be important factors for [creating the right environment ](creating-the-right-environment.md)so this process can function more effectively.



### Contribution execution steps



**1. Select main focus**

First a high level focus should be selected that a group of contributors will focus any of their contribution efforts towards. Any contribution efforts made would be for the benefit of this main focus. The Web 3 Association for instance is solely focussed on treasury systems.



**2. Select small area of contribution**

The next step for contributors to identify is what areas within that focus are most foundational. For treasury systems some examples could be around defining the types of funding initiatives that exist and what data is needed for proposals that match those types of initiatives along with how they could be assessed prior to funding them and tracked or measured once they are funded. Selecting a smaller area of contribution means it will be quicker to research, understand and analyse the different approaches that are being taken for that given area and bring together any learnings or best practices along with any potential areas for further research and development. Keeping the scope small will help with increasing the rate in which the resource can iterate and improve to become a more useful resource for knowledge on that area.



**3. Invite collaborators**

With a small area of contribution selected the next step will be to identify the relevant projects such as existing organisations and emerging web 3 projects. That list of suitable communities can then be contacted to invite them to collaborate with the ongoing efforts around the area of contribution that is about to be worked on. The collaboration invite can also include a request to share any existing learnings, data and insights that would be useful for the research and analysis. Existing projects do not need to collaborate with the contributors working on any specific area of work, providing there is enough information publicly the research and analysis can be effectively executed.



**4. Research**

After any initial knowledge gathered from invited participants is collected the next step will be to thoroughly research the existing market and collate any available research papers, reports, previous or current implementations and any usage or adoption data into a list of resources. The goal here is find the most useful and insightful information rather than trying to cover every potential source of information. Research should try to cover what is actually happening or that has previously happened around different solutions for a given problem area. After an initial round of research is completed the resource should be shared for feedback to identify if there is noteworthy information missing.



**5. Analyse**

Analysis can be started once sufficient research starts to emerge with enough depth around the contribution focus area. Analysis should help with identifying and exploring the problems that exist, where problems have been effectively solved and the solutions that exist, what similarities and differences exist between different implementations, the effectiveness of different implementations that exist or that previously existed and any overall trends on what remaining problems exist or around the usage and adoption of each solution. This analysis should be shared with any relevant communities to identify any missing factors or if any discrepancies or misinterpretations of the data exist or if any information is missing which would improve or contradict any findings from the analysis.



**6. Suggest solution approaches**

Once the focus area is better understood through research and analysis the next step will be to make some initial suggestions on how to solve the problems of the selected contribution area using existing or improved solution approaches. Suggested solutions could be data structures, processes, specifications, formulas or anything else that helps with making suggested improvements to any existing or future solution. The goal of this step is to help foster experimentation wherever needed to better solve any of the problems identified and to determine whether any suggested solutions could be worth consideration and adoption amongst any of the existing projects. The solutions being suggested only create more meaningful impact once they are adopted and properly trialled in real world scenarios. Assumptions and hypothesis will need be tested and improved based on wider feedback and usage data and then also compared with other existing approaches to yield new learnings. Collaboration with existing communities will be the most important part for these suggestions to identify which projects are looking to trial out different approaches to improve their own solution. If no existing projects are able or willing to trial a new suggested approach then contributors making the suggestion can look for new emerging project and support their efforts to trial a new approach. The overall aim of these iterations is to identify the solution or group of solutions that are performing most effectively and to support their continued evolution with potential suggestions for improvement. It should be expected that multiple iteration loops of research, analysis and solution suggestions will be made before establishing which solutions are most effective, what tradeoffs each one may have and where there is any room for improvement and experimentation.



**7. Create reference implementations**

Once the more effective and widely adopted solutions emerge and there is a higher level of confidence that a solution is performing effectively there is a benefit in applying effort to create resources for other project teams to implement and integrate that solution into their own solution. Open source reference implementations could be created to operate on the different web 3 ecosystem blockchains and applications that exist. These reference implementations could then be adapted, used and integrated into any existing projects to most benefit their own solution approach. Further feedback and iteration can be expected as adoption grows for any of the existing implementations or from new projects adopting reference implementations. Making it easy to adopt the most effective solutions to specific problems helps to increase the speed in which that solution is tested with real world use and more nuanced edge cases. In turn this usage can result in higher rates of iteration where needed and over time increased confidence in the effectiveness of any increasingly adopted solution. Reference implementations will help with making it easier for new solutions to emerge and further experiment with how that problem can be solved.



**8. Encourage & support efforts towards areas of potential standardisation**

Prominent solutions to a given problem should eventually emerge that are increasingly well tested with real world usage. Once this begins more effort can be directed towards identifying what solution or group of solutions the wider ecosystem is converging around and how they could be standardised. If commonalities clearly emerge between solutions or if a single solution has been proven to be the most effective then attempts for standardisation can be made. Collaboration can be invited from many participants on what data structures, terminology, technical specifications, documentation and detail could be needed to help turn an existing solution into a more official and well documented standard. Different problem areas will have a different range of ways they could be solved with different levels of complexity on how to solve them. This can produce vastly different levels of experimentation, iteration and adoption being needed to effectively address and understand that a solution is actually effective and how that solution could then be standardised.
