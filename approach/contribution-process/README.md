# üèÉ‚ôÇ Contribution Process

The contribution process focuses on the order of execution for each of the contribution outcomes. Each step in this process is important for maximising the potential impact of the shared learning approach that is being adopted. In terms of [creating the right environment](creating-the-right-environment.md) for this process to operate most effectively some factors of importance and worth consideration will include impact alignment, collaboration, improving the execution process, increasing participation diversity and providing ongoing maintenance and support to any contribution outcomes.&#x20;





### **Knowledge resources (Short term)**

The usefulness and insights made available by any knowledge resources we create will ultimately determine how much impact the Web 3 Association will make on supporting and improving treasury systems. Any knowledge resources that we create will be revisited on an ongoing basis as new insights, data and feedback emerge. Knowledge resources are the most important contribution outcome for the Web 3 Association if we are to effectively achieve our goal of making the more impactful resources possible for learning about and improving treasury systems.



**1. Identify focus area**

Initial contribution outcomes made towards supporting and improving treasury systems will be achieved selecting one focus area at a time to start the iterative process of inviting collaboration, conducting research and analysis and then making suggestions to create useful knowledge resources. Contributors operating under a shared learning approach will collaborate with teams building treasury systems to identify which areas are the most important to work on in the short term. Some example areas could be defining the types of funding initiatives that can exist with what data is needed for different proposals types, how they could be assessed prior to funding them and also how they can be tracked or measured once funded. Selecting smaller areas of focus will help with speeding up the process of going through the iterative loop of creating knowledge resources, getting feedback and then repeating the process to keep improving those resources.



**2. Invite collaborators**

Once a small area of contribution is selected the next step will be to invite collaborators from any teams building treasury solutions. These collaborators could come from existing business and organisations as well as emerging web 3 ecosystems. Invitations for collaboration will include a request for feedback on what areas they believe should be prioritised in the short term and then also some information regarding how these contribution outcomes could benefit their own treasury systems ongoing development. Existing projects will not need to collaborate with the contributors working on these specific areas of work for the contribution outcomes to be generated. Effort should be made to increase the amount of participation wherever possible to help with increasing the diversity of insights and opinion that can be incorporated into the knowledge resources.



**3. Research**

After any initial knowledge and insights is gathered from invited collaborators the next step will be to thoroughly research the existing market and collate any available research papers, reports, previous or current implementations and any usage or adoption data into a comprehensive resource. The goal is find the most useful and insightful information rather than trying to cover every potential source of information. Research should try to cover what is actually happening across the industry or what has previously happened around different solution approaches that existed to solve certain problem areas. After an initial round of research is completed the resource can be shared for feedback to identify if any noteworthy information missing.



**4. Analyse**

Analysis can be started once there is a sufficient amount of research around the contribution focus area. Analysis will help with identifying and exploring the problems that exist, where problems have been effectively solved and what solution approaches have been used, what similarities and differences exist between different implementations, the effectiveness of different implementations that exist or that previously existed, any overall trends on what remaining problems need to be solved and also about the usage and adoption of these solutions. This analysis would be shared to identify any factors that may be missing, what misinterpretations may exist or when any further information could be needed to improve or contradict any findings.



**5. Make suggestions**

Once the focus area is better understood through research and analysis the next step will be to make some initial suggestions on how to solve the problems of the selected contribution area using existing or improved solution approaches. Suggested solutions could be data structures, processes, specifications, formulas or anything else that helps with making suggested improvements to any existing or future solution. The goal of this step is to help foster experimentation wherever needed to better solve any of the problems identified and to determine whether any suggested solutions could be worth consideration and adoption amongst any of the existing projects. The solutions being suggested only create more meaningful impact once they are adopted and properly trialled in real world scenarios. Assumptions and hypothesis will need be tested and improved based on wider feedback and usage data and then also compared with other existing approaches to yield new learnings. Collaboration with existing communities will be the most important part for these suggestions to identify which projects are looking to trial out different approaches to improve their own solution. If no existing projects are able or willing to trial a new suggested approach then contributors making the suggestion can look for new emerging project and support their efforts to trial a new approach. The overall aim of these iterations is to identify the solution or group of solutions that are performing most effectively and to support their continued evolution with potential suggestions for improvement. It should be expected that multiple iteration loops of research, analysis and solution suggestions will be made before establishing which solutions are most effective, what tradeoffs each one may have and where there is any room for improvement and experimentation.



### **Open source software (Medium term)**

As more knowledge resources are created and trends begin to emerge we might identify opportunities to develop open source software that will benefit a wide range of teams building treasury systems. It is not certain how often these opportunities will emerge. The key consideration will be looking at what existing open source software already exists in different ecosystems and then with that in mind then determining how widespread the impact would actually be from making any contribution efforts towards improving the availability of open source software for some or all of these ecosystems.



**6. Develop software**

Once the more effective and widely adopted solutions emerge and there is a higher level of confidence that a solution is performing effectively there is a benefit in applying effort to create resources for other project teams to implement and integrate that solution into their own solution. Open source reference implementations could be created to operate on the different web 3 ecosystem blockchains and applications that exist. These reference implementations could then be adapted, used and integrated into any existing projects to most benefit their own solution approach. Further feedback and iteration can be expected as adoption grows for any of the existing implementations or from new projects adopting reference implementations. Making it easy to adopt the most effective solutions to specific problems helps to increase the speed in which that solution is tested with real world use and more nuanced edge cases. In turn this usage can result in higher rates of iteration where needed and over time increased confidence in the effectiveness of any increasingly adopted solution. Reference implementations will help with making it easier for new solutions to emerge and further experiment with how that problem can be solved.



### **Standards (Long term)**

Establishing standards has a myriad of benefits for improving the efficiency, robustness and scalability of different protocols and applications. An opportunity to support standardisation efforts can emerge if solutions begin converging increasingly towards a similar approach to solve certain treasury problems. Some areas will be more difficult to standardise than others however supporting any efforts when this is the case will be an effective way to further support and improve existing and emerging treasury systems across different ecosystems.&#x20;



**7. Support standardisation**

Prominent solutions to a given problem might eventually emerge. These solutions would become increasingly well tested through real world usage. Once this occurs more effort can be directed towards identifying what solution or group of solutions the wider ecosystem is converging around and how they could be potentially standardised. If commonalities emerge between solutions or if a single solution has been proven to be the most effective then attempts for standardising this approach can be made. Collaboration would be encouraged from many participants on what data structures, terminology, technical specifications, documentation and further details could be needed to help with turning any existing solution into a technically documented and openly available standard. Each treasury focus area can have a range of ways that the problems can be solved and each could have different levels of complexity on how to solve them. Vastly different levels of experimentation, iteration and adoption might be needed to effectively address and understand whether a solution is truly effective. Due to this any efforts towards supporting standardisation should be seen as a longer term goal.
