# ðŸ¤² Contribution Outcomes

The following is a list of contribution outcomes that can be created to help with increasing the amount of knowledge and resources available to support and improve important web 3 areas such as treasury systems. Any of these contribution outcomes would go through continuous improvement using any further insights, data and feedback collected through existing projects across each ecosystem. Constant iteration and improvement will help with creating an increasingly impactful amount of knowledge based resources and open source code to help the growing number of projects building solutions.



### **1. Knowledge resources**



**Timeline**

Short term. All efforts in the beginning phase of the Web 3 Association will revolve around bringing together research and insights and producing analysis around the different areas relevant to treasury systems. Over time this should create a comprehensive set of knowledge based resources that further the understanding of how treasury systems can and are being approached and improved.&#x20;



**Contribution outcomes**

* Research - Researching and aggregating information to identify and document what is currently happening across ecosystems in terms of different solutions to a given problem area and also from projects that are no longer operating where that information is worth including. Research could include existing research papers, reports and how existing and previous solutions have been implemented such as their data structures, usage and adoption metrics along with any other relevant factors such as operating costs or income streams. Research should be focussed on the facts and data around what has or is happening rather than any analysis, interpretation and opinion.
* Analysis - Analysis created using the research gathered will look for existing and emerging learnings that should be considered along with up to date trends on how solutions are being created and improved such as their data structures, processes or the overall approach being taken. Common mistakes or pitfalls can be identified wherever applicable along with any areas for improvement. Differences and similarities between any existing solutions can also be compared to help identify and analyse whether variation between solutions may or may not be necessary when solving the same problem.
* Suggested approaches - The research and analysis of how a problem area can and has been solved will help provide some initial suggestions towards approaches that could effectively solve the problem. This would be an active working document that is updated and improved as new case studies, data and learnings are made from the real world usage of existing solutions solving a similar problem.



**Benefits of achieving these outcomes**

* Aggregated source of knowledge - Bringing this research and analysis together will create an easy to access source of information for existing project teams to use and benefit from whenever it is beneficial for them to do so.
* Shared learnings - Looking at each existing solution and bringing together the insights, data and adoption information will help to identify learnings in each of the ecosystems and better help with sharing those learnings with other active teams.
* Identify areas of alignment - Comparing how each team is approaching their own solution will help identify areas that are being solved in similar ways and that overlap. This creates opportunities to sport areas that are converging on a more standardised way of solving that problem when the solution is working effectively in many real world scenarios.
* Identify main problem areas - Bringing together and analysing the performance of different solutions will help make it clearer where the main problems are with each system and which ones are having the largest detrimental impact in each community. This knowledge can help guide future efforts on where to spend more time to better support existing teams improve in these areas.
* Save existing projects time - Providing an open source collection of resources and knowledge gives existing teams the opportunity to save time in identifying and adopting effective solutions for different parts of their own system. Any time saved can then be spent solving different or more important problems in their own community.



### 2. Open source software

Understanding the [benefits of open source software](open-source-software-overview.md) becomes more clear and obvious when reflecting on some of the most popular services and solutions being used today which integrate, use and rely on open source software.



**Timeline**&#x20;

Mid term. As more resources are produced that help with pointing to effective solution approaches to defined problems more effort can be placed into the creation of open source software to make it easier for new and existing teams to implement those solutions. &#x20;



**Contribution outcomes**

* Technical specifications - When suggested solutions emerge to solve different problem areas a technical specification can be created to help guide how that solution could be created. As an example a simple technical specification could simply focus on what data structure to use with any data types and constraints to apply when following that suggested model. This type of resource makes it easier for those building solutions to implement any suggested solution.
* Tools & libraries - Some common problems can be solved through the creation of open source tools or libraries. For instance, in web 3 ecosystems an example tool that could be of value could be a library for smart contract developers to use for storing and retrieving data easily from existing file storage blockchains. If there is a clear and common patterns of a process or usage of certain systems then considerations can be made for what tools or libraries could be made to automate or increase the effectiveness in which teams can perform a given process or use certain systems.
* Reference implementations - As effective solutions emerge for solving different problem areas an open source reference implementation can be made to help new and existing teams have something they can integrate or use as a reference. Making reference implementations will be most effective when there is more of a converging agreement on an effective way to solve a problem as then a vast number of teams would benefit from integrating the solution in the forms of robust and tested open source code.



**Benefits of achieving these outcomes**

The [benefits of adopting open source software](open-source-software-overview.md) are numerous and include factors such as helping increase the development speed of teams, flexibility in how they integrate solutions, removing vendor lock ins and increasing the rate of innovation [amongst other benefits](open-source-software-overview.md).



### 3. Standards

Standards are an important north star goal to help with development and adoption of important areas in web 3 ecosystems. Although this is may be an important goal, establishing new standards could be very challenging. Standards require a thorough understanding of a problem area, the identification and development of an effective solution to solves those problems and then sufficient evidence, usually through real world usage and adoption, to demonstrate that a given solution is both suitable and actually becoming a standardised way of solving those problems.



**Timeline**&#x20;

Long term. As treasury systems across different ecosystems begin to scale more effectively the chance of identifying common solutions to specific problems should increase. If there is an increasing amount of converging agreement around how to solve certain problems then this would be the right time to contribute towards supporting any efforts to standardise parts of these treasury systems so that all solution builders can benefit from these standards.



**Contribution outcomes**

* Identify areas suitable for standardisation - Effort should be directed towards identifying when a highly effective solution emerges or when solutions are converging towards a similar approach to solve certain problems. Once identified this problem area is suitable for looking in how it could be standardised by encouraging further collaboration with existing solution teams and making continued efforts to find out what further work would be needed for an effective approach to become more widely adopted and accepted as a potential standard.
* Support any efforts towards standardisation - If there is emerging agreement on a way to standardise a specific problem area then one useful contribution outcome will be helping with the process of actually standardising those solution approaches. This could include documentation, technical specifications, defining terminology or bringing together insights and expertise from the different participants in each community.



**Benefits of achieving these outcomes**

The [benefits of adopting standards](standards-overview.md) are numerous such as how they can help increase efficiency, robustness and interoperability of solutions which adopt them. Any of the contribution outcomes that help lead to the improvement or adoption of emerging standards will help yield those benefits.
