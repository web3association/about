Our goal is to help accelerate the development and improvement of Web3 treasury systems and funding processes. We’re particularly interested in supporting ecosystems with improving their funding processes. Even small improvements could generate very meaningful returns on investment for the ecosystem.

We're interested in evaluating any part of your funding process to help with identifying any trends, suggestions and areas for improvement. Some areas we could help with include:

* **Reviewing funding outcomes** - Outcomes generated by the funding process can be reviewed to better understand what actual impact has been generated.
* **Data planning** - The only way to truly know whether a funding process has been improving over time or not is to record, measure and analyse enough data. We can help with reviewing what data should be collected so that it becomes easier to make decisions about how to evolve and iterate the funding process.
* **Data analysis** - Funding processes can produce a lot of data. Collecting and aggregating these data sources can help with identifying trends and creating reports about what has actually been happening. We can take this data to explore any similarities or differences that exist with other funding processes across the industry. Example areas that could be explored could include the rates of completion or fraud, stakeholder feedback and current sentiments and investigations into what the total participation time and cost estimations currently are for the funding process.
* **Identifying suggestions** - Some of the most impactful suggestions we can make will come in the form of identifying low cost and high impact experiments that could be trialled in the ecosystem. Suggestions that could become long term solutions if successful. Another area of focus is to better understand what is already happening across the industry and then identify and suggest already adopted solution approaches that have already demonstrated their effectiveness.
* **Industry research & trends** - We can conduct research and analysis to help with identifying any key trends about what is happening across the industry. Efforts could be focused on identifying best practices or creating new data sources for further analysis. Creating more tailored reports about more specific topic areas could also be another area of focus.
