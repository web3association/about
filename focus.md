# ðŸŽ¯ Focus

The sole focus of contributions made by the Web 3 Association will be the creation of knowledge and resources that support the continued development and improvement of treasury systems across web 3 ecosystems.



### **Why focus on treasury systems?**

Treasury systems help with the storage, management and distribution of assets owned by a community. Existing governments and institutions as well as many emerging web 3 projects are all examples of communities both large and small that rely on effective treasury systems to manage how funds are collected and distributed to most effectively benefit their communities.

Determining how to best manage and distribute treasury funding is difficult. There is a vast range of ways and purpose that assets could be used for to most benefit a community. Making group wide decisions is challenging as each decision of where to distribute funding can each have a number of different trade offs.

Web 3 ecosystems have an opportunity to improve and expand on the lessons learnt in existing treasury systems used by existing governments, organisations and communities. Treasury systems adopted in web 3 ecosystems have the potential to become more effective at helping communities make impactful and effective decisions on how best to manage treasury assets. Creating effective treasury systems would provide an increasing amount of evidence to demonstrate how web 3 ecosystems can be more effective than existing systems. Larger communities such as countries are then able to better consider and evaluate how those systems might benefit them and how they could be potentially adopted.



### **The opportunity to improve treasury systems**

Some simple math helps to highlight why there is such a great opportunity to create impact through any contributions towards improving treasury systems across web 3 ecosystems.

The total market cap of cryptocurrencies has been increasing over recent years with a combined total market cap reaching values well above $1 trillion. Within that total market cap there are numerous blockchains, layer two solutions and applications that each have their own treasuries being managed to support the continued development and growth of their communities.

Both [DeepDAO](https://deepdao.io/organizations) and [DefiLama](https://defillama.com/treasuries) are useful tools for finding the aggregated value of some of these treasuries across web 3. Even a conservative estimated value from these sources highlight that there is well over $10 billion currently being managed in treasuries across these communities. Considering that these lists are not exhaustive, and do not include all blockchains and decentralized application projects, this total is likely a fair amount higher.

We can compare how much value would be generated for treasuries by looking at the total treasuries value against what funding is distributed annually per year and then seeing what improvement value could be created by improving those treasuries. Those improvements can be represented as an annual percentage improvement. Improvements could comprise of time savings in developing or managing treasury systems or improvements in how the funding process is operated to most effectively direct funds to the most impactful initiatives.

These simple calculations help provide clarity to the scale of the opportunity in continuously making even small improvements to web 3 ecosystem treasuries.

Even a 1% distribution rate for treasuries that have a combined total value of $10 billion produces an opportunity of $1 million in value that can be created by improving those treasuries on average 1% per year.

As the total value of treasuries increase this opportunity for improvement drastically increases into something very meaningful and also paramount for web 3 ecosystems to address due to the scale of the amount of funding being released from different ecosystems. It will be of paramount importance that these treasury systems can scale and still operate effectively in these conditions when the treasury value increases over time and more community funds are at stake.

Overall, it is clear that even small incremental improvements to treasury systems represent a massive opportunity for web 3 ecosystems. Increasing the accuracy, speed and overall effectiveness of how communities can manage and distribute their treasuries is an opportunity that all ecosystems will benefit from embracing.

Treasuries will represent the economic beating heart of many emerging communities. The better treasury systems perform the more accurately the community will select quality funding initiatives that produce impactful outcomes. The higher the impact produced from treasury systems the more valuable these ecosystems become which leads towards a more valuable treasury. Treasuries are a flywheel growth lever for accelerating web 3 adoption.
