**Professional background**

Software developer of over 6 years in web and mobile development environments. Main technologies I've worked with include JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, React, React Native and GraphQL. More details can be found on my LinkedIn.



**Relevant experience**

I helped contributed towards the funding process from Cardano called [Project Catalyst](https://projectcatalyst.io/). Whilst contributing there I helped provide research and analysis about funding categorisation approaches to help with finding more effective solutions. That analysis work led to changes being made to the funding process which even with conservative estimates would lead to around a 200% return on investment in a single funding round.
