# ðŸ’š Sponsor A Contributor

## Contributor sponsorship overview

Each contributor involved in the Web 3 Association operates independently and will request and receive funding from any potential sponsor.

There is no incorporated entity for the Web 3 Association. In the future we will explore what structure makes sense for the group of contributors involved. In the short term we intend to keep things simple and let contributors operate independently.

For now our sole priority is focussed on producing the initial round of knowledge resources and collaborating with any existing project teams so we can provide value as soon as possible.

Once we have proven the our approach of focussing on shared learnings is an effective way to create impact for a diversity of teams building treasury systems we can then explore what organisational structures and what sponsorship or membership based models could be suitable.&#x20;
