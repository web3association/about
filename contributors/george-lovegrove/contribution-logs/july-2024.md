# July 2024

**Contribution duration** - Full month



## Overview

* Voting score approaches - Looked at the different parts of score voting approaches to determine what combination of approaches could be the most effective for Web3 ecosystems. Expressive approval voting emerged as a suggestion for ecosystems to explore.
* Contributor funding - The goals and objectives of a contributor funding process were documented along with a development roadmap and a experiment setup guide. The experiment setup guide suggested the tech stack, provided some templates, outlined the parameters and approaches and also made some time and cost estimations.
* Contributor funding example - An example resource was made to showcase what a contributor funding experiment could look like. The suggested tools were created and filled in with some example data to give a good idea of what the funding process could look like in practice.
